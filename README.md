# Shop Animal Crossing Tara's personal project :ledger: :koala: :cat:

Hello folks :blush: this is a personal project i started in april or may 2024. 

## What is this about ? :thinking:

This is an attempt to made a kind of online shop or marketplace, but focus with a theme i like, which is Animal Crossing, because the notions i try to learn are hard and i decided to use a subject i like to progress in a fun and joyfull way... Please note that most of the designs (illusttations of the objects and characters) are not my properties, this is Nintendo's. I only created this project for a personal use, without any commercial purpose. This is like fanart but in webdesign...

## A little secret about this project... :sparkles: 

We are now in November 2024 and i actually tought that this project was lost when i changed from computer during the last summer, i was sad :pensive: because actually multiple projects where lost at this moment, but i just discovered some of these file on my new computer :partying_face: this is a very good surprise (i actually saved this record from my old computer in a place i didn't think of before today so i decided to quickly add these projects to my github to be able to get them back and work on these project one day). Today i feel lucky thanks to this discovering. :partying_face: 

I decided to make it public because i actually think this is a fun project. Enjoy... :relaxed: :sparkles:
